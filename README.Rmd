The goal of `AtlanticForestMetacommunity` is to walk the user through the statistical analysis presented in:  

**Pelinson et al "Disentangling the multiple drivers of amphibian metacommunity structure in the Atlantic Forest at multiple spatial scales"**  
DOI: NOT YET AVAILABLE

The analyses were divided in three different sections:

[Descriptive Statistics](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/AtlanticForestMetacommunity/blob/master/Descriptive%20Statistics/Descriptive-Statistics.md)

[Variation Partitioning](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/AtlanticForestMetacommunity/blob/master/VarPart/Variation-Partitioning.md)
