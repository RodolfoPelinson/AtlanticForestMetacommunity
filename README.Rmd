The goal of `AtlanticForestMetacommunity` is to walk the user through the statistical analysis presented in:  

**Pelinson et al 2022 "Disentangling the multiple drivers of tadpole metacommunity structure in different ecoregions and multiple spatial scales"**  
DOI: [10.1007/s10750-022-04967-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-04967-w)

The analyses were divided in three different sections:

[Descriptive Statistics](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/AtlanticForestMetacommunity/blob/master/Descriptive%20Statistics/Descriptive-Statistics.md)

[Variation Partitioning](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/AtlanticForestMetacommunity/blob/master/VarPart/Variation_Partitioning.md)

[RDA Plots](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/AtlanticForestMetacommunity/blob/master/RDAs/RDAs.md)

[Elements of Metacommunity Structure](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/AtlanticForestMetacommunity/blob/master/EMS/EMS.md)
